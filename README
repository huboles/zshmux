## zshmux 2.0

### about
when a new shell is launched zshmux checks if there are any tmux sessions.
if you are not already in a tmux session zshmux will list all currently active sessions, 
then ask if you want to attach a currently running session, or make a new session in the shell.
if there is only one tmux session running and not attached to any clients, zshmux 
will just automatically attach the session to the current shell.

### using
- add `[[ -d PATH/TO/ZSHMUX ]] && source PATH/TO/ZSHMUX/zshmux.sh` in your .zshrc
- open a new shell

### other shells
zshmux should work with any bash compliant shell, as it no longer implements any zsh specific functions.

### installation
download or clone this repo and move `zshmux.zsh` to desired directory. then source in your `.shellrc`
