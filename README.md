# zshmux

If a new shell is launched, *zshmux* quickly checks if there are any tmux sessions, or if the current shell is already in a tmux instance.
If you are not already in a tmux session *zshmux* will list all currently active sessions, and ask if you want to attach a currently running session, or make a new session in the shell.

## How to use:
-Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/huboles/zshmux`

-Source *zshmux* in your .zshrc: `source <path-to-zshmux>/zshmux/zshmux.zsh`

-Open a new shell
